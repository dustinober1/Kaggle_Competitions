## üìà Chart Explanations

### Model Performance Comparison
The final model comparison shows Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy at 95.8%, outperforming Random Forest (91.6%), SVM (92.5%), Gradient Boosting (93.5%), and the Tuned Neural Network (92.5%). This demonstrates that traditional ML algorithms can be highly effective for structured job market data.

### Skills Market Share Distribution
The pie chart reveals Python's dominance in the job market, representing 15.1% of all skill requirements. Communication skills (11.5%) rank second, highlighting the importance of soft skills alongside technical abilities. The distribution shows a healthy mix of programming languages, tools, and interpersonal skills.

### Experience Level Value Analysis
The bar chart comparing Fresher vs Experienced roles shows that experienced positions require more skills on average (12.0 vs 10.3) and represent a larger job volume (4.76 vs 3.63 normalized units), indicating higher market value and demand.

### Analysis Techniques Complexity vs Impact Matrix
The scatter plot positions different analytical techniques based on their technical complexity and business impact. Neural Networks score highest in both dimensions (8,9), while Time Series analysis shows the highest complexity (9,8). This helps prioritize which advanced techniques provide the best return on analytical investment.

### Skills Clustering Visualization
The PCA visualization shows distinct clusters in 2D space, with Cluster 1 (general technical) being the largest and most dispersed, while specialized clusters (DevOps, Leadership) form tighter, more distinct groups. This validates the effectiveness of the clustering approach.

### Topic Distribution by Experience Level
The stacked bar chart reveals how different job responsibility topics vary by experience level. Entry-level positions focus heavily on Topic 5 (support/learning), while experienced roles emphasize Topics 1 and 2 (leadership and product management).
