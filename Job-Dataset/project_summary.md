# Job Market Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This data science project analyzes a comprehensive job dataset with 1,068 job postings to extract insights about the job market, particularly focusing on .NET Developer positions and their requirements across different experience levels.

## Dataset Details
- **Size**: 1,068 job records
- **Columns**: 7 features including JobID, Title, ExperienceLevel, YearsOfExperience, Skills, Responsibilities, Keywords
- **Job Types**: 218 unique job titles
- **Experience Levels**: 11 different categories (Fresher, Experienced, Entry-Level, Mid-Senior Level, etc.)

## Key Features Built

### 1. Data Exploration & Analysis
- Comprehensive data quality assessment
- Experience level distribution analysis
- Skills frequency analysis and trends
- Job requirements comparison across experience levels

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Text parsing of skills data (semicolon-separated to lists)
- Numeric experience extraction from text ranges
- Skills count calculation
- Responsibilities word count analysis
- Binary encoding for top skills
- TF-IDF vectorization of job responsibilities

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Models Implemented**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting
- **Task**: Experience level classification (Fresher vs Experienced)
- **Features**: 65+ engineered features including skills indicators and text features
- **Evaluation**: Cross-validation, confusion matrices, performance metrics

### 4. Visualizations & Insights
- Experience level distribution charts
- Skills demand analysis (top 20 skills)
- Skills comparison between experience levels
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance comparisons
- Skills word clouds (when available)
